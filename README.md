> Example running Cypress E2E tests on CircleICI using Yarn and Orb

This project uses Yarn to install NPM dependencies, it runs Cypress E2E tests on CircleCI and uses [Cypress CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb) to do its magic. See how simple [circle.yml](circle.yml) file is.
